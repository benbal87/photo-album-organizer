### Photo album renaming:

This is a mini project with the goal to rename all image and video files in one directory and all of it's subdirectories. 
The directories which are containing the media files have to be named customized. 
* The names of these directories will be the root names of the media files.
* Then the media file with the latest creation date in a directory will be the reference for the start of the media file names with the following format: "YYYY-MM-DD".
* The files then will be numbered with the following format if there are not more than 999 in a directory: 001, 002, etc.
* The video files will get a "video" string before their numbers.
* All of the files will be numbered by their creation dates.
